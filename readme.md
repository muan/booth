# Booth

A photo booth. I made this because macOS Photo Booth wouldn't reveal external video input sources and I don't know why. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This works pertty well in Chrome, and is definitely quite buggy in Firefox and Safari for reasons I don't care to dig into. ;)

Fujifilm X100T was as a webcam in the screenshot above.
