# Booth

A photo booth. I made this because macOS Photo Booth wouldn't reveal external video input sources and I don't know why. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This works pertty well in Chrome, and is definitely quite buggy in Firefox and Safari for reasons I don't care to dig into. ;)

Firefox
  - unable to obtain the correct ratio.
  - unable to connect to sources occasionally.

Safari
  - unable to obtain all the available video inputs.
  - need to command click to open dataURL in a new tab.

In Chrome, use the left and right arrow to navigate between shots when one of them is expanded.
